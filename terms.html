        <h3>Your Account</h3>
        <p>You must provide us accurate information when you create your Ongig account. Your Ongig account gives you access to Services and functionality we may establish and maintain in our sole discretion.

You may never use another user’s account without permission.</p>

        <p>Ongig’s Services focus on delivering the following value:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Assisting employers in attracting job candidates. Ongig does this primarily through helping employers create Content (e.g. Web pages, email or other and electronic communications) and distributing that Content to potential job candidates. </li>
        <li>Assisting individuals in finding their next job. Ongig does this primarily by listing jobs on Ongig.com and messaging job candidates who have provided their contact information through the Ongig platform. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with Ongig or a third-party service. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (e.g. using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols with your account). You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. Ongig cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You must notify Ongig immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>Your privacy is important to Ongig; so we've developed a <a href="/pages/privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a> that covers how we collect, share, track, disclose and store your information.</p>
        <h3>Third-Party Websites, Advertisers Or Services</h3>
        <p>Ongig may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, or services that are not owned or controlled by Ongig.</p>
        <p>Ongig has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services. If you access a third party website from Ongig, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement and Ongig’s Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites. You expressly relieve Ongig from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or services or third party owned content. Additionally, your dealings with or participation in promotions of advertisers found on Ongig, including payment and delivery of goods, and any other terms (such as warranties) are solely between you and such advertisers. You agree that Ongig shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to your dealings with such advertisers.</p>
        <p>We recommend you be aware of when you leave the Service, and read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of third-party websites or services that you visit.</p>
        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Ongig and its subsidiaries, agents, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from your use of and access to the Service, including any data or Content transmitted or received by you, any other party’s access or use of the Service with your username and password, or your violation of these Terms, applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
        <h3>Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>THE ONGIG SITE AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING ANY SOFTWARE) AND SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED BY ONGIG ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. ONGIG MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THIS SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING ANY SOFTWARE) OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE ONGIG SITE, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THIS SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, ONGIG DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ONGIG DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THIS SITE; INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING ANY SOFTWARE) OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE ONGIG SITE; ITS SERVERS; OR E-MAIL SENT FROM ONGIG ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ONGIG WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE ONGIG SITE OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE ONGIG SITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. CERTAIN STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h3>
        <p>THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Ongig with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Ongig’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Ongig may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Ongig and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.</p>

Employer further agrees that “Powered by Ongig” or similar marks may appear in forms, web pages and other outputs of our Services.</p>   
        <h3>Modifications</h3>

By continuing to access or use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.</p>
